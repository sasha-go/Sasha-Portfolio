            <p class="aboutDesc"> I’m a full stack developer and recent graduate from Thinkful’s Nights and Weekends Engineering program.  
                I began my career providing world class customer support at GoFundMe and I soon witnessed how meaningful a product could positively impact users in the real world. 
                Overtime, I became passionate about improving the quality of our product and learning more about its inner workings. 
                Luckily, I was surrounded by teammates who inspired me to reach beyond my limits and encouraged me to contribute on a level I never thought was possible. 
            </p>
            <p>This quickly led to my transition into Quality Engineering and now Full Stack Development. I'm dedicated to building software 
                products that cater to the user experience and leave a positive imprint on our world.
            </p> 
            <p>When I’m not coding, you can find me at the dog park with my rescue pup, at the climbing gym with friends, or cozily curled up reading a book. 
                 I’m a life long learner who thrives when presented with a big challenge, whether that be a marathon or coding bootcamp.
